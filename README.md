# Projects Feed

This is a React application that:

- displays a list of projects
- has the ability to search for a specific projects by name

## Development

How I built this app:

- Used CRA to generate the source files
- Used react hooks to retrieve the projects (useState, useEffect)
- useEffect is used to mock a real-world API call
- Used react-testing-library and jest to unit test the react components
